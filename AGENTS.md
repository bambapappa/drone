# Project agent memory

## Architecture

Two independent code paths in this repo:

- **`app/`** — the realtime PoC (FastAPI + WS + live web GUI). Runs via `docker compose up`.
- **`analysis/`** — the new offline training/evaluation tool (batch, sequential,
  multi-pass). Carved from `app/vision/` analyzers; shares no runtime with the
  realtime path. Runs via `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.offline.yml run --rm analyze /videos/film.mp4`.

Key architecture doc: the report at the path in this task's brief (design of record
for the offline tool). Code-level citations are in the companion scout report.

### Offline tool: module map

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `analysis/ingest.py` | PTS index, video hash, PiP detection, `FrameStore` |
| `analysis/store.py` | Versioned JSONL sidecar + manifest.json |
| `analysis/orchestrator.py` | Sequential multi-pass driver (P1→P5) |
| `analysis/cli.py` | `analyze <video>` entry point |
| `analysis/tiling.py` | N×N tile grid + NMS (carried forward, unchanged) |
| `analysis/registry.py` | `PersonRegistry` (carried forward, unchanged) |
| `analysis/behavior.py` | `BehaviorAnalyzer` (carried forward, unchanged) |
| `analysis/situation.py` | `SituationAnalyzer` (carried forward, unchanged) |
| `analysis/flow.py` | `GlobalMotion`, `BoxFilter`, `local_box_flow` |
| `analysis/pip.py` | `PipAutoDetector` (carried forward) |
| `analysis/detector.py` | YOLO + BoT-SORT wrapper (carried forward) |

The carved-out analyzer modules in `analysis/` are independent copies of their
`app/vision/` originals. The realtime `app/vision/` modules are left untouched.
Both code paths evolve independently — this is an addition, not a replacement.

### Timebase

The offline tool uses **video time**: `t = frame_no / fps` (PTS-corrected).
The realtime PoC uses `time.monotonic()`. The analyzers themselves accept `t`
as a float parameter and are unchanged — only the caller swaps the timebase.
BoT-SORT's `track_buffer` is re-expressed as `fps × seconds` (not a fixed 120).

### Artifact schema

Sidecar store at `<output>/<run_id>/`:
- `manifest.json` — video hash, config hash, model, seed, pass log
- `frames/<pass>.jsonl` — per-frame metadata
- `detections/<pass>.jsonl` — per-detection with raw appearance embedding
- `checkpoints/<pass>/` — resumable state

## Captain's product decisions (durable)

- The offline tool's review UI (Phase 2+) must be **Swedish-only** — no English
  strings in any user-facing GUI text. The existing realtime GUI is already Swedish.
- The offline tool must be runnable via `docker compose` end to end, like the
  realtime PoC is today (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.offline.yml run analyze <video>`).
- This is an addition alongside the realtime PoC, not a replacement or a
  dual-mode rewrite of it.

## Build / test / lint

```bash
make venv && source .venv/bin/activate    # set up dev environment
make test                                  # pytest tests/ -v
make lint                                  # ruff check + format check
```

CI runs `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` on `app/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `analysis/`,
then `pytest tests/ -v`.

## Docker

```bash
# Realtime PoC
docker compose up --build

# Offline analysis
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.offline.yml run --rm analyze /videos/film.mp4
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.offline.yml run --rm analyze /videos/film.mp4 --tiles 2 --imgsz 1280
```

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
